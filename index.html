						<h5>USING THE RIGHT MATERIALS FOR YOUR PROJECT</h5>
						<p>
							Do you want a basement to turn into your man cave? Getting a
							basement or garage with concrete flooring is a great idea for many
							reasons. This material is durable, inexpensive, versatile and easy
							to work with. You can then cover the concrete flooring with any
							other flooring of your choice or paint it to imitate the look of
							stone or marble.
